# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. My motivation for this project was to learn these languages and help others get started as well. This project helped solve the issue of people wanting to code but not knowing where to start. This project can guide them in learning the basics and getting them interested in coding. Movies and shows always made me think coding was difficult, but, I learned it isn't. It's learning a few basics and then it's an open world of possibilities from there.
